# ml-regressions
A bunch of regressions in Python and R from my studies and other projects

Completed so far:
- R/Py: SLR (linearized with Gradient Descent in Py)
- R/Py: Logistic (linearized with Gradient Descent in Py)
- R: MLR
- R: GLMs
- R: Methods for variable selection in regressions
- R: parametric bootstrapping 
- R: Elastic Net Logistic Regression (L1 and L2)

Things left to to do:
- Lots of cleaning and story telling
- Py: Linearized Multivariate Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- Py: Linearized Multivariate Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent (and other GLMs)
- Py: L1 (LASSO) & L2 (RIDGE) Linear Regression 
- R/Py: Regression kernels
- R/Py: Bayesian regression
